This is the development tree for WhirlyGlobe 2.0.  As of now (5/12) 2.0 is not yet released.

You're better off using WhirlyGlobe 1.2 from its google code page, particularly if you're just getting started:

If you want to use this version for some reason, talk to me (Steve) about that first.  I've made the 2.0 pre-release public because I'm collaborating with other people (clients).  If you don't fall into that category, best to wait until the formal 2.0 release sometime this summer.

What is WhirlyGlobe (1.2)?

WhirlyGlobe is a self contained 3D earth display view suitable for use in iPhone and iPad applications. The globe is rendered in OpenGL ES with a configurable multi-part texture and allows for vector data overlays. It is intended as a (relatively) lightweight widget that can be dropped in to your app to do simple data overlay and interaction with a globe. It can also do more heavy duty data interaction if you want to use it as the centerpiece for a globe based app.

It's about big data.  Paging giant imagery data sets on the fly, that sort of thing.

It's about maturity.  WhirlyGlobe has found its way into some iPad melting apps and they have certain needs.

And it's about maps.  I'm branching out from a simple 3D globe and moving into interactive maps.  That won't make 2.0, but you can see the structural changes already.

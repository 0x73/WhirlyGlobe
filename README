What is WhirlyGlobe?
---

WhirlyGlobe is a self contained 3D earth display view suitable for use in iPhone and iPad applications. The globe is rendered in OpenGL ES with a pageable quad tree texture and support for vector data overlays. It is intended as a (relatively) lightweight widget that can be dropped in to your app to do simple data overlay and interaction with a globe. It can also do more heavy duty data interaction if you want to use it as the centerpiece for a globe based app.

This is the master branch of the WhirlyGlobe API.  It's the one you want, if you want the API.  However, I'd urge you to consider using the WhirlyGlobe Component.  It's simpler and does much of what the API can do.  Go check out that web page for details.

So you're determined, eh?  Well okay then.

WhirlyGlobe uses a bunch of submodules, which you'll need to get.
Once you've switched over to the develop branch (and how else would you be reading this), do the usual:

git submodule init
git submodule update

Get comfortable.  The data is contained in a submodule and it's large.

Once you get all this synced, try to build WhirlyGlobeComponentTester.  If it builds, you're good to go.  Enjoy.

          <p>There are two main parts to WhirlyGlobe, (1) the main WhirlyGlobe API, (2) WhirlyGlobe Component.  The latter is built on top of the former, as you might expect</p>

<p>You probably want the Component.  It's a framework that lets you add an interactive 3D globe to your iPad or iPhone app.  The interface is entirely Objective-C and it's pretty easy to use.</p>

<p>To get the WhirlyGlobe Component, just head on over to the downloads area and grab the latest:
<a href="https://github.com/mousebird/WhirlyGlobe/downloads">https://github.com/mousebird/WhirlyGlobe/downloads</a></p>

<p>If you want to know more about the WhirlyGlobe Component, check out the announcement:
<a href="http://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com/2012/08/whirlyglobe-component-announcement.html">http://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com/2012/08/whirlyglobe-component-announcement.html</a></p>

<p>If you need to dig a bit deeper then take a look at the WhirlyGlobe API.  Just clone the repository and use the master branch.  You'll need a whole mess of support libraries as well.  Look at the notes file under WhirlyGlobeLib for details.</p>

<p>The old WhirlyGlobe 1.2 repo can be found on google code:

<h2>What is WhirlyGlobe?</h2>

<p>WhirlyGlobe is a self contained 3D earth display view suitable for use in iPhone and iPad applications. The globe is rendered in OpenGL ES with a pageable quad tree texture and support for vector data overlays. It is intended as a (relatively) lightweight widget that can be dropped in to your app to do simple data overlay and interaction with a globe. It can also do more heavy duty data interaction if you want to use it as the centerpiece for a globe based app.</p>

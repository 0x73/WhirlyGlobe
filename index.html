<h2>WhirlyGlobe</h2>
<p>The WhirlyGlobe Component is a framework you can use to put an interactive 3D globe in your app.  You can provide base imagery, including networked tile data sets, labels, vectors, shapes, or even overlay UIView's.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Component is entirely Objective-C and we've precompiled it so you can drop it directly into your app and go.  For instructions on how to use it, please read the <a href="http://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com/2013/12/whirlyglobe-22.html" title="WhirlyGlobe 2.3 Announcement">announcement</a>
.</p>

<p>To download the current <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/whirlyglobemaplydistribution/WhirlyGlobe_Maply_Distribution_2_3.zip" title="WhirlyGlobe Component Release">release version</a>
  of the WhirlyGlobe component, click the link above.<p>

<h2>Maply Component</h2>
<p>The Maply Component is a flat map display framework based on the same technology as WhirlyGlobe.  They share the vast majority of their code and features and are, in fact, distributed as the same toolkit with different entry points.<p>

<h2>WhirlyGlobe-Maply 2.3 Component</h2>

<p>The latest version of WhirlyGlobe-Maply is 2.3 and you can get it either as source from github or as a binary distribution.  The binary version contains the test app, a framework for the toolkit, and enough source data to run the app.</p>

<p>It's all very powerful.  WhirlyGlobe-Maply is built on a simple rendering engine that lives on the main thread.  You add your content through a variety of data control layers which live in a separate thread.  It's smart about data management and getting smarter all the time.</p>

<p>For a general overview of the features, watch the WhirlyGlobe and Maply videos.  For more specific functionality, compile and run the WhirlyGlobeComponentTester app and run through the options.</p>

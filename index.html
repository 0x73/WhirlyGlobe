<h2>WhirlyGlobe Component</h2>
<p>The WhirlyGlobe Component is a framework you can use to put an interactive 3D globe in your app.  You can provide base imagery, including networked tile data sets, labels, vectors, or even overlay UIView's.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Component is entirely Objective-C and we've precompiled it so you can drop it directly into your app and go.  For instructions on how to use it, please read the <a href="http://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com/2012/08/whirlyglobe-component-announcement.html" title="WhirlyGlobe Component Announcement">announcement</a>
.</p>

<p>To download the current <a href="https://github.com/downloads/mousebird/WhirlyGlobe/WhirlyGlobeComponentDistribution_1_1_0.zip" title="WhirlyGlobe Component Release">release version</a>
  of the WhirlyGlobe component, click the link above.<p>

<h2>Maply Component</h2>
<p>The Maply Component is a flat map display framework based on the same technology as WhirlyGlobe.  They share the vast majority of their code and features and are, in fact, distributed as the same toolkit with different entry points for each.<p>

<p>Maply is being introduced with version 2.1 and can be obtained as part of the WhirlyGlobe-Maply distribution<p>

<h2>WhirlyGlobe-Maply 2.1 Component (beta)</h2>

<p>The latest version of WhirlyGlobe-Maply is 2.1 and though it's still under development, it's fairly stable.  You can check out the develop branch on github, or you can get a <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29069465/WhirlyGlobe-MaplyComponentDistribution_2_1_beta2.zip"> binary distribution</a> of beta2.

<p>Version 2.1 adds quite a bit of functionality at the Component level.  Check out the <a href="http://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com/">mousebird consulting blog</a> for details.</p>

<h2>WhirlyGlobe-Maply API</h2>

<p>Where the Component is meant for simplicity, the API exposes it all in glorious detail.  WhirlyGlobe-Maply is built with a combination of C++ and Objective-C.  It pulls in a variety of open source projects, including <a href="http://www.boost.org/" title="Boost Home Page">Boost</a>, <a href="http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php" title="Clipper Home Page">Clipper</a> and <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" title="Eigen Home Page">Eigen</a>.  It makes heavy use of the Standard Template Library.  It's tricky if you're not familiar with Objective-C++.</p>

<p>If you can handle it, it's very powerful.  WhirlyGlobe-Maply is built on a simple rendering engine that lives on the main thread.  You add your content through a variety of data control layers which live in a separate thread.  It's smart about data management and getting smarter all the time.</p>

<p>For a full list of features, check out the WhirlyGlobe 2.0 <a href="http://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com/2012/09/whirlyglobe-20-new-features.html" title="WhirlyGlobe 2.0 announcement">announcement</a>
 and look at the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whirlyglobe/id440860199?mt=8" title="WhirlyGlobe App">WhirlyGlobe App</a>
 in the app store.</p>

<p>To get started with the WhirlyGlobe-Maply API... well first reconsider using the Component.  It's much easier.  But if you're determined, clone the <a href="https://github.com/mousebird/WhirlyGlobe" title="WhirlyGlobe github repository">WhirlyGlobe repository</a>
 and use the master branch.  Check the README for dependencies, of which there are several, and get started.</p>

Getting Started With WhirlyGlobe-Maply
=============

So you've decided to create an IOS application with a globe or a flat map, and you want to use WhirlyGlobe­Maply. Good call. Plenty of other people have done so, and most of them are sane.

And you're reading this, so there's a good chance you've visited the main project page. But, if you haven't, or it's been a while, read the latest at http://mousebird.github.io/WhirlyGlobe/ before continuing. It's also a good idea to visit the documentation here: <here> and reference it early and often.

This document will walk you through the necessary steps to get started with WhirlyGlobe­Maply, or WG-­Maply for short. At the end you will have written a simple globe­based app and a simple map based app. The finished projects are available for reference on github <here>, but working through these examples yourself, particularly if you are new to WG­Maply, is recommended. <possibly ­ some comment about git tags relating to manual sections, such as 'Adding A Layer' or 'Remote Image Tiles', if git repo has been set up this way.>

Xcode 5.1 and WG­Maply 2.3* were used to prepare this guide. If you're using a newer version of either Xcode or WG­Maply, there may be minor changes required.

A brief note on style: there are many instances in which you will need to enter project settings, code, or commands in the Terminal application verbatim. In each case, the exact text required will be noted in a fixed­width font, like so.

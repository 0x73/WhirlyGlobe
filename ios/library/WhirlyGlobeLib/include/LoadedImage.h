/** Type of the image being passed to the tile loader.
 UIImage - A UIImage object.
 NSDataAsImage - An NSData object containing PNG or JPEG data.

 PVRTC4 - Compressed PVRTC, 4 bit, no alpha
 PKM - ETC2 and EAC textures
 Placeholder - This is an empty image (so no visual representation)
 that is nonetheless "valid" so its children will be paged.
